I finished the logo by the end of Week 4, and started to do work for Weeks 5 & 6. However, I was unable to attend the tutorials due to personal
reasons. So I watched the tutorials online, only to find no videos or slideshow accompanying it. So since I had no video to help teach me the
basics, I had to try and use the internet, which as you can see, did not end well. I understand I failed the assignment. I just wish the
slideshows were publically available, as that would of helped me a lot. I do not know if this means I failed the subject or just the assessment,
but either way, next time will be different.

Thank you for your time.
